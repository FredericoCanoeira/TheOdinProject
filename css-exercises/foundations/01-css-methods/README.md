# Methods for Adding CSS

In this exercise, I'm going to practice adding CSS to an HTML file using the external CSS method.


## The properties need to add to each element are:

div: a red background, white text, a font size of 32px, center aligned, and bold
p: a green background, white text, and a font size of 18px
button: an orange background and a font size of 18px

# Desired Outcome



### Self Check

Used the external methods of adding CSS to an HTML file.
The div element have CSS added via the external method.
The p element have CSS added via the internal method.
The button element have CSS added via the inline method?
