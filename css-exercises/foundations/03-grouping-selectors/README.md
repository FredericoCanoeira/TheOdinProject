# Grouping Selectors

Let's build a little off the previous exercise, in which you (hopefully) added multiple classes to a single element in order to apply two different rules to it.

Instead of having a single element with two different rules applied, though, you're instead going to give two elements each a unique class name, then add rules for styles that both elements share as well as their own unique styles. 

The properties needed to add to each element are:

- The first element: a black background and white text
- The second element: a yellow background
- Both elements: a font size of 28px and a list of fonts containing Helvetica and Times New Roman, with sans-serif as a fallback
- Desired Outcome

## Self Check
Does each element have a unique class name?
Did you use the grouping selector for styles that both elements share?
Did you make separate rules for the styles unique to each element?
